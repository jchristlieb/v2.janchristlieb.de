                <p>Hi, my name is Jan. I life in Berlin and work as a freelance web developer. However, this is not what
                    I have done my entire career.</p>
                <p>Indeed my focus throughout my studies were on management and marketing. I earned master degrees from
                    the University of Twente in Business Administration and the TU Berlin in Innovation Management.</p>
                <p>Consequently, I started my career in an IT management position as a product owner for a credit
                    reporting agency. It turned out that product development from a business perspective was not as
                    satisfying as I hoped it to be.</p>
                <p>I resigned after two years. At this time my next task was not set but my vision was clear. Doing
                    something I am truly passionate about.</p>
                <p>I love bicycles. I use them as a mean of transportation, as a sport utility, and I like to handpick
                    the components and assemble them myself. Passion detected.</p>
                <p>Radweiser was the attempt to combine my passion and my profession. The idea was to help people find a
                    bike that suits their needs and wants. Therefore I started to develop a bike consultancy app.</p>
                <p>While working on the market maturity of my project, I learned two lessons: first, technical skills
                    are essential for entrepreneurial survival, and second, my strong limitation of exactly those skills
                    in need.</p>
                <p>I paused Radweiser due to my (former) disability of transforming my idea of a profound bike
                    consultancy app into a competitive product. Nevertheless, I developed a distinct joy and fascination
                    for code and grasped the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.</p>
                <p>Those acquired coding skills helped me to land opportunities as freelance developer. My goal is to
                    deliberately practice and develop my coding capabilities. It is a challenging and satisfying path
                    that I look forward walking on.</p>
